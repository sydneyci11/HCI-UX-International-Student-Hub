# 🎓 HCI Project: Supporting International Students in London

## 📌 Project Overview
This research is part of the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) coursework**, focusing on how **digital tools can improve the experience of international students moving to London**. The study aims to develop an **information hub** that centralizes resources such as:

- 🏠 **Accommodation support**
- 💰 **Financial tips & student discounts**
- 🗣️ **Language and university adaptation guidance**
- 👫 **Social networking and student community engagement**
- 🩺 **Mental health & well-being support**  

## 🎯 Project Goals
1. Understand International Students’ Pain Points → Conduct interviews and analysis.
2. Develop a User-Centric Solution → Apply Design Thinking (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test).
3. Prototype a Supportive Application → Provide a centralized platform for housing, finances, mental support, and social networking.

## 🔍 Research Process
1. **Empathize & Define**
- Conducted **30+** interviews with international students.
- Created **Empathy Maps** and identified common challenges.

2. **Ideation & Brainstorming**
- Used **Thinking Hats**, **How Might We (HMW) Questions**, and a **How-Now-Wow Matrix** to refine ideas.
- Created **Storyboards & Sketches** to visualize user scenarios.

3. **Prototyping & Testing**
- Designed a Figma prototype of the app: [View on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/Yqw39K1NnPebK1WENffMD5/HCI?node-id=0-1&p=f)
