# 🎓 HCI Project: Supporting International Students in London

## 📌 Project Overview
This research is part of the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) coursework**, focusing on how **digital tools can improve the experience of international students moving to London**. The study aims to develop an **information hub** that centralizes resources such as:
