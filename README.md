# 🎓 HCI Project: Supporting International Students in London

## 📌 Project Overview
This research is part of the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) coursework**, focusing on how **digital tools can improve the experience of international students moving to London**. The study aims to develop an **information hub** that centralizes resources such as:
transportation, finances, and social integration.
- 🏠 **Accommodation support**
- 💰 **Financial tips & student discounts**
- 🗣️ **Language and university adaptation guidance**
- 👫 **Social networking and student community engagement**
- 🩺 **Mental health & well-being support**

This project was completed as part of a 10-week HCI course at King’s College London. Our goal was to investigate the pain points faced by international students newly arriving in London and co-design a centralized digital tool to help them adapt, connect, and thrive.

## 🎯 Project Goals
1. Understand International Students’ Pain Points → Conduct interviews and analysis.
2. Develop a User-Centric Solution → Apply Design Thinking (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test).
3. Prototype a Supportive Application → Provide a centralized platform for housing, finances, mental support, and social networking.

## 🔍 Research Process
1. **Empathize & Define**
- Conducted **30+** interviews with international students.
- Created **Empathy Maps** and identified common challenges.
- Developed **Personas** representing key user groups.
- Formulated **Problem Statements** addressing financial, social, and academic difficulties.

2. **Ideation & Brainstorming**
- Used **Thinking Hats**, **How Might We (HMW) Questions**, and a **How-Now-Wow Matrix** to refine ideas.
- Created **Storyboards & Sketches** to visualize user scenarios.

3. **Prototyping & Testing**
- Designed the Figma prototype with modular flows (accommodation, finance, mental health, social).
- Designed a Figma prototype of the app: [View on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/Yqw39K1NnPebK1WENffMD5/HCI?node-id=0-1&p=f)
- Conducted usability testing and refined the prototype.
- My main design focus was on the mental health interface, including access to resources and peer connection features.
- We conducted usability tests and heuristic evaluations, iterated based on user feedback.

### My Key Contribution
In a team of six, I led research and ideation for the mental health module of a digital support tool for international students in London. I conducted 5 user interviews, developed empathy maps and personas, defined the problem space, and facilitated ideation using tools like thinking hats and HMW. I also designed key Figma prototype screens focused on mental health support and peer connection.
- **Led UX Research for the mental health module:** conducted 5 in-depth interviews, synthesized findings into empathy maps and personas.
- **Defined Problem Scope using design thinking tools:** facilitated team workshops with Six Thinking Hats and HMW questions.
- **UI Design Lead for Mental Health Interface:** designed and iterated Figma screens, emphasizing emotional accessibility and peer connection.

## 🧪 Experimental Evaluation (Individual UX Research)
As an individual extension of this team project, I designed a controlled experiment to evaluate how the information hub prototype could impact international students’ adaptation and well-being.

This study followed a between-subjects experimental design with pre- and post-surveys to measure:
1. Stress reduction and emotional well-being
2. Social connection and cultural adaptation
3. Engagement with different platform modules

Key considerations included sampling strategy, construct validity, and ethical concerns.
This project demonstrates my ability to integrate UX design with experimental methods, delivering data-driven insights that inform usability and product decisions.
